Alternatively (and more often), a requestor may notify one or more potential fulfillers that they have a which must be performed. Those potential fulfillers may respond back with a 'bid' describing the service they could perform. The details of that 'bid' will vary by care-domain, but may indicate the performer's availability, the details of a more specific service they would perform, cost, information about the specific performer who may provide the service, etc.

The requestor and the patient may then review the information received from potential performers and then decide which specific performer will be used.
